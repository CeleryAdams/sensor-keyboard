#sensor-keyboard

Using an Arduino board to control keyboard inputs using various sensors. Interfaces with a connected computer via serial communication, so that you can turn keyboard functions on and off during runtime from another program running on the computer. Useful as the basis for a tactile game controller that makes use of a variety of sensory inputs such as light sensors and accelerometers, with the ability to control which sensors are activating keypresses under specific conditions.

Compatible with any Arduino board with HID support. Tested with Unity using [Ardity](https://github.com/dwilches/Ardity).
